# Research Paper Text Summarization Tool

A Python-based GUI tool that simplifies the summarization of research papers or any large text files using machine learning. The tool provides an intuitive user interface with options for loading text files, generating summaries, saving the output, and much more.

## Features

- **Summarization with AI**: Powered by Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with `Tkinter`, featuring colorful designs and smooth transitions.
- **File Management**: Load text files and save summaries with ease.
- **Customizable Summary**: Adjust the length of summaries as needed.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instantly processes input text into concise summaries.
- **Scrollable Instructions**: Clear and detailed steps for usage.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Enhanced UI with transitions and visual effects.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.8 - 3.11 is installed on your system.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required libraries.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-paper-summarization-tool.git
   cd research-paper-summarization-tool
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download necessary machine learning models:
   The Hugging Face `transformers` library will automatically download the required pre-trained models during the first run.

## Usage

1. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Load your research paper or any text file:
   - Click on the **Load File** button to browse and load a `.txt` file.

3. Summarize the text:
   - Click the **Summarize** button to generate a concise summary of the loaded text.

4. Save the summary:
   - Use the **Save Summary** button to save the generated text into a `.txt` file.

5. Optional:
